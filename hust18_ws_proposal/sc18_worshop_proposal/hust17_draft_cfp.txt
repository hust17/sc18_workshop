Call for participation
======================

HUST-17:  Fourth International Workshop on HPC User Support Tools.

Held in conjunction with SC17: The International Conference on High
Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis.

Denver, CO, USA on 12-17 November 2017.


Background
----------

Supercomputing centers exist to drive scientific discovery by
supporting researchers in computational science fields.  To enable users
to be more productive in these complex HPC environment, in Larger HPC centers 
they can provide sys-admins and user support teams.  These teams serve many roles, from setting up
accounts, to consulting on math libraries and code optimization, to
managing HPC software stacks.  In smaller centers it may be 1-2 people that 
is responsible for everything. Adequately supporting scientists can
often be a struggle for the support teams regardless of size.  HPC environments are
extremely complex, and combined with the complexity of multi-user
installations, exotic hardware, and maintaining a research software stack,
supporting HPC users can be extremely demanding.  Meeting all of these
competing demands of the scientists often results in the creation of
new tools and establishment of new policies and best practices.

With the fourth HUST workshop, we will continue to provide a necessary
forum for system administrators, user support team members, tool
developers, policy makers and end users to discuss support issues.  We
solicit papers on user support experiences, best practices, tools, and
any efforts to streamline support at supercomputing centers.

For more information, please see the HUST-17 website [1].

Topics
------

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- defining and customising the user environment
- software build and installation tools
- tools and frameworks for using system performance analysis tools
- workflow and pipeline tools
- collaboration tools
- novel environments: cloud, support for Docker.
- tools and frameworks for supporting Hadoop and Big Data
- establishing baseline configuration efforts for HPC
- software development/system testing
- documentation: creating, maintaining and updating

Submission
----------

We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. Papers should be submitted in PDF format and should not
exceed 10 pages including tables, figures and appendices, but
excluding references. They should be formatted according to the
standard SC17 format, i.e., the double-column IEEE format for
Conference Proceedings (IEEEtran LaTeX Class (template) V1.8 packages
and IEEEtran V1.12 BibTeX (bibliography)). Similar to the SC15 policy,
margins and font sizes should not be modified. We kindly refer authors
to the necessary templates [2].

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair
website [3].  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Proceedings will be published in both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital
library through collaboration with ACM SIGHPC.
